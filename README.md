# sensor enabled actuator along with voice control application in arduino based robot

> **Abstract** : This is an Arduino based robot with sensors and actuators along with voice control. It is an Arduino obstacle avoidance and voice control robot, it is a robotic system that can detect and avoid obstacles in its path using sensors, and can also be controlled using voice commands. The robot is built using an Arduino microcontroller, which is a small computer that can be programmed to control various electronic devices. It also has an additional feature of changing direction when obstacle is detected.
